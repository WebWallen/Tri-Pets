Tri Pets, an extremely effective and beautifully designed pet adoption website by Daniel Wallen.

Every time I share a link to the adoptable dogs and cats, the local animal shelter receives DM's RE: adopting one.

This website has led to a minimum of 50 pet adoptions -- probably a hundred plus -- and big money for the animal shelter.

Visit the live website to see the current look and feel (hint: the best stuff is on the blog and about page):
