Tri Pets, an extremely effective and beautifully designed pet adoption website by Daniel "Dogfather" Wallen.

Visit the live website to see the current look and feel (hint: the best stuff is on the blog and about page) ---> www.tripets.org

Don't expect daily commits (I'm merely adding the code here so I don't have to explain my lack of green squares in future interviews).

But I WILL update the HTML, CSS, and JS files on occasion. Ditto for the website associated with my mental health memoir, Madness and Me.
