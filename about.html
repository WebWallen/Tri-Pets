  <p class="paragraph-8">Picture too small? Turn your phone sideways (same applies to the rest).</p>
  <h2 class="about-subheader">See? Told you so.</h2>
  <p class="about-paragraph">I&#x27;m the guy who goes to parties, isolates the dog, ignores the humans, and spends my evening playing with Fido. <br><br>All dogs are awesome, but pit bulls have a special place in my heart, because they&#x27;re the #1 most misunderstood breed.<br><br>Despite the dishonest claims of biased news stories and flawed studies, I&#x27;ve never met a pit bull with an aggressive bone in their body.<br><br>Sure, they might not like cats. And they may prefer living in a home where they can get ALL the attention. But they&#x27;ve never bit or barked at me (and I&#x27;ve walked fifty). </p><img src="images/petworks_volunteer_of_the_month_cropped.jpg" alt="Petworks newsletter from July, which named Daniel Wallen their Volunteer of the Month" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 688px" srcset="images/petworks_volunteer_of_the_month_cropped-p-500.jpeg 500w, images/petworks_volunteer_of_the_month_cropped.jpg 648w" class="about-image">
  <h2 class="about-subheader">People call me the Dogfather.</h2>
  <p class="about-paragraph">And there&#x27;s a good reason. <br><br>Over the last two years, I&#x27;ve walked 125 dogs. <br><br>After each walk, I promote the dogs with a Facebook status about their unique quirks and personality.<br><br>115 of those dogs are now in a happy home. Can&#x27;t claim full credit, but I bet the 11,156 social media shares helped. <br><br>Not to mention the 271,575 people reached (according to data in Facebook Page Manager), which is almost double the Tri-Cities population. </p><img src="images/tripets_about_status_sample.jpg" alt="Sample of the kind of status updates Daniel Wallen writes to get dogs adopted. This one shows a black Lab/Terrier mix named Ringo." class="about-image">
  <h2 class="about-subheader">The dogs saved me more than I saved them.</h2>
  <p class="about-paragraph">I was in a dark and depressing place before I found purpose at the animal shelter.<br><br>Suicide crossed my mind more than a few times. For a while, it was a daily consideration. <br><br>This isn&#x27;t the appropriate time or place to get deeper into that issue; suffice to say, I fell into a pit of despair.<br><br>The dogs helped me climb out and find the light. They didn&#x27;t care about my past mistakes. Their love was unconditional. <br><br>Dogs are also content as heck. They don&#x27;t expect any grand gestures. A drive with the windows down, walk at the park, and belly rubs are enough to make them happy.</p><img src="images/tripets_about_newspaper_story.jpg" alt="Front page news story from the Kingsport Times-News that covered Daniel Wallen&#x27;s activities at his local animal shelter, Petworks Kingsport Animal Services" class="about-image">
  <h2 class="about-subheader">The dogs helped me heal and be a better human.</h2>
  <p class="about-paragraph">As the front page Kingsport Times-News headline says, I have adopted a dog&#x27;s perspective on life. Best decision ever.<br><br>Like dogs, I&#x27;m more content. As long as I get some food and exercise, I&#x27;m happy, although a little love and affection never hurts.<br><br>No dog will argue about politics or religion. And neither do I. Most people are too attached to their opinions. It causes division. So I try not to have opinions at all.<br><br>The peace-of-mind that followed is unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever experienced. My mental health has never been better. And it&#x27;s all because dogs taught me to focus on the few things that matter.</p><img src="images/tripets_about_cartoon.jpg" alt="Cartoon drawn by a freelancer on Fiverr that shows the first fifty dogs Daniel Wallen walked.

  <h2 class="about-subheader">Now I aim to help shelter cats, too.</h2>
  <p class="about-paragraph">Every time I try to put a leash on a cat, they hiss at me (that was a joke -- I&#x27;m sure they would though).<br><br>That&#x27;s how Tri Pets began. I like cats, but can&#x27;t walk them or take their pictures outside. So I needed another approach.<br><br>I also might be moving soon. Three months ago, I graduated a coding school. Sadly, there aren&#x27;t many technology jobs in the region.<br><br>If relocation becomes a must, I&#x27;ll still be able to help Petworks and the Kingsport, TN pets they serve by updating their rosters once a week or two.<br></p><img src="images/tripets_about_status_cats.jpg" alt="Status update published at the end of June about the push to get cats and kittens from Petworks Kingsport animal shelter adopted (there&#x27;s a black cat, grey cat, and kitten snuggled against Daniel Wallen&#x27;s head)" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 582px" srcset="images/tripets_about_status_cats-p-500.jpeg 500w, images/tripets_about_status_cats.jpg 542w" class="about-image">
